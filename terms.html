Transactions.</strong> All proposed Steem blockchain transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Steem blockchain via the Steem distributed consensus network (a peer-to-peer network), which is not owned, controlled, or operated by us. The Steem blockchain is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties. We have no control over the Steem blockchain and therefore cannot and will not ensure that any transaction details you submit via the Services will be confirmed on the Steem blockchain. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Steem blockchain. You may use the Services to submit these details to the Steem blockchain.

We cannot assist you with Account password retrieval, reset, or recovery. You are solely responsible for remembering your Account password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Account and password pairs maintained in your Account, you accept and acknowledge that any STEEM, Steem Dollars and Steem Power you have associated with such Account will become permanently inaccessible if you do not have your Account password.
